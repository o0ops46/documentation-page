          React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and <span class="bold">you can
            use as little or as much React as you need</span>. Whether you want to get a
            taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a
            complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get
            started.

            If you’re interested in playing around with React, you can use an online
            code playground. Try a Hello World template on <span class="blue">CodePen</span>, <span class="blue">CodeSandbox</span>, or
            <span class="blue">Stackblitz</span>.

            If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also <span class="blue">download this
              HTML file</span>, edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your
              browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so we’d only
              recommend using this for simple demos.

              As your application grows, you might want to consider a more integrated
              setup. There are several JavaScript toolchains we recommend for larger
              applications. Each of them can work with little to no configuration and
              lets you take full advantage of the rich React ecosystem. <span class="blue">Learn how</span>.

            The React documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in the

            learn both React and JavaScript at the same time.</p><p>
              
              We recommend going
              through <span class="blue">this JavaScript overview</span> to check your knowledge level. It will
              take you between 30 minutes and an hour but you will feel more confident

              techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building any

                  React components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. React components can be defined by subclassing <span class="yellow"> React.Component</span> or <span class="yellow">React.PureComponent</span>.
