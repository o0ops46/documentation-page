      <h3 id="try-react">Try React</h3>
      <p>
        React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and <span class="bold">you can
        use as little or as much React as you need</span>. Whether you want to get a
        taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a
        complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get
        started.
      </p>

      <h3 id="playgrounds">Online Playgrounds</h3>
      <p>
        If you’re interested in playing around with React, you can use an online
        code playground. Try a Hello World template on <span class="blue">CodePen</span>, <span class="blue">CodeSandbox</span>, or
        <span class="blue">Stackblitz</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also <span class="blue">download this
        HTML file</span>, edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your
        browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so we’d only
        recommend using this for simple demos.
      </p>

      <h3 id="add-react">Add React to a Website</h3>
      <p>
        You can <span class="blue">add React to an HTML page in one minute</span>. You can then either
        gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic
        widgets.
      </p>
      <h3 id="create-app">Create a New React App</h3>
      <p>
        When starting a React project, a <span class="blue">simple HTML page with script tags</span> might
        still be the best option. It only takes a minute to set up!
      </p>
      <p>
        As your application grows, you might want to consider a more integrated
        setup. There are several JavaScript toolchains we recommend for larger
        applications. Each of them can work with little to no configuration and
        lets you take full advantage of the rich React ecosystem. <span class="blue">Learn how</span>.
      </p>
      <h3 id="learn">Learn React</h3>
      <p>
        People come to React from different backgrounds and with different
        learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical
        approach, we hope you’ll find this section helpful.
      </p>
      <ul class="prefference">
        <li>
          If you prefer to <span class="bold">learn by doing</span>, start with our practical tutorial.
        </li>

        <li>
          If you prefer to <span class="bold">learn concepts step by step</span>, start with our guide to
          main concepts.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Like any unfamiliar technology, React does have a learning curve. With
        practice and some patience, you will get the hang of it.
      </p>

      <h3 id="examples">First Examples</h3>
      <p>

        The<span class="blue"> React homepage</span> contains a few small React examples with a live editor.
        Even if you don’t know anything about React yet, try changing their code
        and see how it affects the result.
      </p>

      <h3 id="beginners">React for Beginners</h3>
      <p>

        If you feel that the React documentation goes at a faster pace than you’re
        comfortable with, check out <span class="blue">this overview of React by Tania Rascia</span>. It
        introduces the most important React concepts in a detailed,
        beginner-friendly way. Once you’re done, give the documentation another
        try!
      </p>

      <h3 id="designers">React for Designers</h3>
      <p>

        If you’re coming from a design background, <span class="blue">these resources</span> are a great
        place to get started.
      </p>

      <h3 id="javascript-resource">JavaScript Resources</h3>
      <p>

      </p>
      The React documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in the
      JavaScript language. You don’t have to be an expert, but it’s harder to
      learn both React and JavaScript at the same time.</p><p>

        We recommend going
        through <span class="blue">this JavaScript overview</span> to check your knowledge level. It will
        take you between 30 minutes and an hour but you will feel more confident
        learning React. 
      </p> 
      <span class="yellow">
<p class="bold">
Tip
</p>
       Whenever you get confused by something in JavaScript,
       <span class="blue">MDN</span> and <span class="blue">javascript.info</span> are great websites to check. There are also
       <span class="blue">community support forums</span> where you can ask for help.
      </span>
        
      <h3 id="practical">Practical Tutorial</h3><p>

        If you prefer to <span class="bold">learn by doing</span>, check out our <span class="blue">practical tutorial</span>. In this
        tutorial, we build a tic-tac-toe game in React. You might be tempted to
        skip it because you’re not into building games — but give it a chance. The
        techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building any
        React apps, and mastering it will give you a much deeper understanding.
      </p>

      <h3 id="guide">Step-by-Step Guide</h3><p>

        If you prefer to <span class="bold">learn concepts step by step</span>, our <span class="blue">guide to main concepts</span>
        is the best place to start. Every next chapter in it builds on the
        knowledge introduced in the previous chapters so you won’t miss anything
        as you go along.
      </p>

      <h3 id="thinking">Thinking in React</h3><p>

        Many React users credit reading <span class="blue">Thinking in React</span> as the moment React
        finally “clicked” for them. It’s probably the oldest React walkthrough but
        it’s still just as relevant.
      </p>

      <h3 id="courses">Recommended Courses</h3>
      <p>

        Sometimes people find third-party books and video courses more helpful
        than the official documentation. We maintain <span class="blue">a list of commonly
        recommended resources</span>, some of which are free.
      </p>

      <h3 id="advanced">Advanced Concepts</h3>
      <p>

        Once you’re comfortable with the <span class="blue">main concepts</span> and played with React a
        little bit, you might be interested in more advanced topics. This section
        will introduce you to the powerful, but less commonly used React features
        like <span class="blue">context</span> and <span class="blue">refs</span>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="api-reference">API Reference</h3>
      <p>

        This documentation section is useful when you want to learn more details
        about a particular React API. For example, <span class="blue"> React.Component API reference</span>
        can provide you with details on how <span class="yellow">setState()</span> works, and what different
        lifecycle methods are useful for.
      </p>

      <h3 id="glossary">Glossary and FAQ</h3>
      <p>

        The <span class="blue">glossary</span> contains an overview of the most common terms you’ll see in
        the React documentation. There is also a FAQ section dedicated to short
        questions and answers about common topics, <span class="blue">including making AJAX requests</span>,
        <span class="blue">component state</span>, and <span class="blue">file structure</span>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="informed">Staying Informed</h3>
      <p>
        The <span class="blue">React blog</span> is the official source for the updates from the React
        team. Anything important, including release notes or deprecation
        notices, will be posted there first.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also follow the <span class="blue">@reactjs account</span> on Twitter, but you won’t miss
        anything essential if you only read the blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not every React release deserves its own blog post, but you can find a
        detailed changelog for every release in the <span class="blue">CHANGELOG.md file in the
        React repository</span>, as well as on the <span class="blue">Releases</span> page.
      </p>

      <h3 id="versioned">Versioned Documentation</h3>
      <p>
        This documentation always reflects the latest stable version of React.
        Since React 16, you can find older versions of the documentation on a
        <span class="blue">separate page</span>. Note that documentation for past versions is snapshotted
        at the time of the release, and isn’t being continuously updated.
      </p>

      <h3 id="missing">Something Missing?</h3>
      <p>
        If something is missing in the documentation or if you found some part
        confusing, please <span class="blue">file an issue for the documentation repository</span> with
        your suggestions for improvement, or tweet at the <span class="blue">@reactjs account</span>. We
        love hearing from you!
