        <p>
          At the heart of GitHub is an open source version control system (VCS)
          called Git. Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that
          happens locally on your computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          To use Git on the command line, you'll need to download, install, and
          configure Git on your computer. You can also install GitHub CLI to use
          GitHub from the command line. For more information on GitHub CLI, see
          the GitHub CLI documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to work with Git locally, but don't want to use the
          command line, you can instead download and install the GitHub Desktop
          client. For more information, see "Installing and configuring GitHub
          Desktop."
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't need to work with files locally, GitHub lets you complete
          many Git-related actions directly in the browser, including:
